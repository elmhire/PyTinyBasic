# PyTinyBasic

To better understand programming language design, I decided to implement a Tiny Basic interpreter written in the Python programming lanâ€‘
guage. I chose to implement a recursive decent parser to buld a syntax tree for the Basic instruction input at the interpreter prompt. The
evaluator portion utilizes the node visitor pattern to evaluate the generated syntax tree.

While have not yet finished this project, I learned a great deal about parsers and the ways in which they operate. This project is based on
the recursive descent parser found in David Beazley's Python Coookbook, chapter 2.
